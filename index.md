Welcome to the <a href="https://esiil.org/esiil-stars" target="_blank">**ESIIL Stars**</a> Internship 2023! We are excited to have you in class for the next few months as we introduce you to Earth and Environmental Data Science (EDS) fundamentals using **Python**. This is our first year of the ESIIL Stars Internship and we're glad to be getting started with you all as the first cohort of interns. ESIIL Stars is modeled after the Harnessing the Data Revolution (HDR) **Earth Data Science Corps** (<a href="https://earthlab.colorado.edu/edsc" target="_blank">**EDSC**</a>), which took place from 2020-2022. Both of these programs are funded by the **National Science Foundation** (<a href="https://nsf.gov/" target="_blank">**NSF**</a>).

> ### ESIIL Stars aims to meet the following objectives through technical training and project based learning: 
> * Train the next generation of Earth and Environmental Data Scientists
> * Answer relevant GIS and Earth/Environmental science questions
> * Diversify the EDS workforce
> * Build capacity to teach & learn EDS at partner institutions

This work represents a partnership between **Oglala Lakota College** (<a href="https://www.olc.edu/" target="_blank">**OLC**</a>), **Metropolitan State University of Denver** (<a href="https://www.msudenver.edu/" target="_blank">**MSU**</a>), **United Tribes Technical College** (<a href="https://uttc.edu/" target="_blank">**UTTC**</a>), and **The Environmental Data Science Innovation and Inclusion Lab** (<a href="https://esiil.org/" target="_blank">**ESIIL**</a>). ESIIL is a part of the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (<a href="https://cires.colorado.edu/" target="_blank">**CIRES**</a>) a partnership of the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/" target="_blank">**University of Colorado Boulder**</a> and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (<a href="https://www.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">**NOAA**</a>). We are also affiliated with <a href="https://earthlab.colorado.edu/" target="_blank">**Earth Lab**</a>.  

We appreciate these partnerships and look forward to working with you all!

## Course Schedule (Tentative):
### Spring Training (mid-March through end-of-semester)

ESIIL instructors will meet with each team weekly to answer questions and check-in on interns' progress. Sometime in April we will bring all of the teams together to meet as a large group. 

> ### Spring training will include the following topics:
> * Personal websites with **GitHub Pages**
> * **GitHub** for collaboration
> * **Open** and **reproducible** science with Python
> * **Python** fundamentals
> * Tabular and **time-series** data
> * **Vector** and **raster** spatial data

### Summer Group Projects 
Starting in the summer semester (**late-May / early-June**), group projects will begin. From here through the end of the internship (**late-July / early-August**), teams will begin checking-in multiple times per week for regular progress reports, and help sessions for group projects. Each team will be responsible for **designing their own project** to apply the EDS skills learned during the Spring Training. Each team will present their group project during a **final presentation** and in written form through a **project blog post** during the final week of the internship. We will post your presentations and blogs to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@earthlabcuboulder458/featured" target="_blank">**YouTube**</a> channel and other **social media**. We will also discuss **Digital Object Identifiers** (DOI) and other ways to make your work findable and citable.
