Welcome to the <a href="https://esiil.org/esiil-stars" target="_blank">**ESIIL Stars**</a> Internship 2023! We are excited to have you in class for the next few months as we introduce you to Earth and Environmental Data Science (EDS) fundamentals using Python. This is our first year of the ESIIL Stars Internship and we're glad to be getting started with you all as the first cohort of interns. ESIIL Stars is modeled after the Harnessing the Data Revolution (HDR) Earth Data Science Corps (<a href="https://earthlab.colorado.edu/edsc" target="_blank">**EDSC**</a>), which took place from 2020-2022. Both of these programs are funded by the National Science Foundation (<a href="https://nsf.gov/" target="_blank">**NSF**</a>).

> ### ESIIL Stars :star: aims to meet the following objectives through technical training and project based learning: 
> * Train the next generation of Earth and Environmental Data Scientists
> * Answer relevant GIS and Earth/Environmental science questions
> * Diversify the EDS workforce
> * Build capacity to teach & learn EDS at partner institutions

## Course Schedule (Tentative):
### Spring Training (mid-March through end-of-semester)

During the opening weeks of the internship, ESIIL instructors will meet with each team weekly to answer questions and check in on interns' progress. Sometime in April we will bring all of the teams together to meet as a large group. 

During the spring training we will cover the following topics:
* Personal websites
* GitHub
* Open science with Python
* Python fundamentals
* Tabular and time series data
* Spatial data (vectors)
* Spatial data (rasters)


### Summer Group Projects 
Starting in the summer semester (late-May / early-June), group projects will begin. From here through the end of the internship (late-July / early-August), the meetings will increase to 2x weekly for group check-ins, regular progress reports, and help sessions for group projects. Each team will present their group project during a final presentation and in written form through a project blog post during the final week of the internship.
